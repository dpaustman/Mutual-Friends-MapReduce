# Mutual-Friends-MapReduce
Finding mutual friends of users using Hadoop Mapreduce

Input Files: 
1. soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt
2. userdata.txt

Jar File: MapReduce.jar

## Task 1
Write a MapReduce program in Hadoop that implements a simple “Mutual/Common friend list of two friends". The key idea is that if two people are friend then they have a lot of mutual/common friends. This question will give any two Users as input, output the list of the user id of their mutual friends. For example,Alice’s friends are Bob, Sam, Sara, Nancy Bob’s friends are Alice, Sam, Clara, Nancy Sara’s friends are Alice, Sam, Clara, NancyAs Alice and Bob are friend and so, their mutual friend list is [Sam, Nancy] As Sara and Bob are not friend and so, their mutual friend list is empty

The input contains the adjacency list and has multiple lines in the following format: Here, is a unique integer ID corresponding to a unique user and is a comma-separated list of unique IDs ( ID) corresponding to the friends of the user. Note that the friendships are mutual (i.e., edges are undirected): if A is friend with B then B is also friend with A. The data provided is consistent with that rule as there is an explicit entry for each side of each edge. So when you make the pair, always consider (A, B) or (B, A) for user A and B but not both.

Output: The output should contain one line per user in the following format: 
<User_A>, <User_B>  <Mutual/Common Friend List> 

where <User_A> & <User_B> are unique IDs corresponding to a user A and B (A and B are friend).
< Mutual/Common Friend List > is a comma-separated list of unique IDs corresponding to mutual friend list of User A and B.

Please find the above output for the following pairs. (0,4), (20, 22939), (1, 29826), (6222, 19272), (28041, 28056)

## Running part(a)

1. Run the following commands to create a directory on HDFS and put the input files.
  ```
  hdfs dfs -mkdir /test
  hdfs dfs -put <location of soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt on PC> /test
  hdfs dfs -put <location of userdata.txt PC> /test
  ```
  
2. Delete the output directory if it already exists:

```
hdfs dfs -rm -r /test/out
```

3. Run the jar file:
```
hadoop jar <Location of MapReduce.jar on PC> Part1 /test/soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt /test/out
```
